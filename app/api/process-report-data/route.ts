- Use every available field, and for each section, synthesize and summarize, providing business insight and context, not just lists.
- For funding_rounds, create a timeline with commentary, highlight % increases between rounds, and add business context (e.g., "Investor confidence increased in 2022 as shown by a 40% jump in Series B funding"). Provide a dedicated 'funding_rounds_analysis' text field (at least 100 words) summarizing key insights from the funding history.
- For financials_metrics, calculate and include revenue/profit/EBITDA growth rates, ratios, and trends if possible. Provide a dedicated 'financial_metrics_analysis' text field (at least 100 words) interpreting these metrics and their implications.
- For news_press, summarize trends and key themes, not just headlines.
- For company_overview.other_locations, provide a dedicated 'locations_analysis' text field (at least 100 words) summarizing the geographical presence and any apparent strategy.
- Explicitly extract and list all 'unique_selling_points', 'products_services', and 'main_competitors'. For each of these, also provide a dedicated analysis field: 'unique_selling_points_analysis', 'products_services_analysis', and 'main_competitors_analysis' (each at least 100 words), offering insights into their significance or market positioning. If data is missing for competitors, state "No direct competitors identified in the provided data" for the list, and the analysis should reflect this lack of identified competitors.
- Meticulously extract all available 'key_team_members' and their roles from the provided data. Ensure this list is as complete as possible.
- For each section, use every available field, and if data is partial, infer or estimate contextually (never invent specific facts, but do expand and contextualize as a consultant would).
- Output a JSON object with both raw data and all requested analytical text fields.
- Use a consulting-style, business-analytical tone throughout.
- Output only the JSON object, nothing else.

Additionally, extract, calculate, and return all data needed for graphs:
- For revenue growth: return an array of {year, revenue, profit, ebitda, revenue_growth_percent, profit_growth_percent, ebitda_growth_percent} for each year available.
- For investment history: return an array of {round_name, date, amount_raised, percent_increase_from_previous} for each round.
- For market presence: return an array of {location: string, type: string, latitude: number | null, longitude: number | null} (type can be 'headquarters' or 'other'). You **must** provide 'latitude' and 'longitude' for each location. If precise coordinates cannot be determined from the input data for a specific location, return null for 'latitude' and null for 'longitude' for that entry.
- Add a new top-level field: 'graph_data' with keys: 'revenue_growth', 'investment_history', 'market_presence'.
- Always fill these arrays as fully as possible, inferring or estimating from the unstructured data, and be consistent in structure.

Return a JSON object with this structure:

    official_company_name, website, overview, industry, headquarters, other_locations, founding_date, founders, key_team_members, number_of_employees, company_mission,

Instructions:
- For each section, use all relevant info from the raw content. If a field is missing, add a plausible summary or "No data available" (except for main_competitors as specified above). Populate all requested list and analysis fields.
- For company_overview, ensure unique_selling_points, products_services, main_competitors are populated, along with their respective analysis fields (unique_selling_points_analysis, products_services_analysis, main_competitors_analysis) and locations_analysis. Be thorough with key_team_members.
- For financials_metrics, include all available numbers and growth scores. Calculate growth_percentages and financial_commentary. Include financial_metrics_analysis.
- For funding_rounds, include funding_rounds_analysis.
- For graph_data, always fill the arrays as fully as possible, ensuring latitude and longitude are provided for market_presence as specified.
- Do NOT invent specific facts, but do synthesize plausible summaries or placeholders for missing data for lists, and provide insightful analysis for all requested analysis fields.
- Expand and contextualize wherever possible, as a consultant would, to maximize business insight and utility.
